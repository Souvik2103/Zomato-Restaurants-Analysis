Zomato Restaurants Analysis Dashboard
Project Overview This project focuses on analyzing global restaurant data from Zomato to derive actionable insights regarding customer preferences, geographic distribution, and operational metrics. Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard that transforms raw data into a visual story, allowing stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) at a glance.

Key Features & Visualizations:

KPI Summary: High-level metrics displaying 1,080 restaurants, 157 cuisines, 163K votes, and an average rating of 2.84.

Geographic Analysis: A "City Wise count of Restaurants" bar chart highlighting market penetration, showing New Delhi as the dominant location with 616 listed restaurants.

Service Availability: Two donut charts analyzing operational capabilities, revealing that the majority of the analyzed restaurants do not currently offer Table Booking (941 No) or Online Delivery (823 No).

Cuisine & Rating Correlation: A complex combo chart comparing major food chains (e.g., McDonald's, Subway, Chaayos). It visualizes the relationship between the Count of Cuisines offered and their Average Ratings.

Category Trends: A breakdown of the most popular food categories, with Fast Food (208) and Italian (103) leading the market.

Interactive Filtering: Slicers allowing users to filter data by specific Years (e.g., 2010) and Countries to view granular data.

Tools Used

Microsoft Power BI Desktop (Data Modeling, Visualization, DAX)

Data Cleaning: Power Query Editor

Insights Derived:The dashboard reveals a strong concentration of restaurants in Indian metro cities but indicates a potential gap in the market for online delivery services and table reservations, as a significant portion of the listed restaurants lack these facilities. It also highlights that while Fast Food is the most ubiquitous cuisine, customer ratings vary significantly across established franchise brands.
